# Getting started with Github pages

In this article, I'm following my initial setup with GitHub Pages.

## The Start

I started with a new repository named 'site' (for lack of a better term). Before
taking my next step, I browsed [github's
help](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually://help.github.com/categories/20/articles)
on the topic.

## The Orphan Branch

Since I just started a new repo, I wasn't too worried about starting with a
fresh clone. So I just created the orphan branch right away and followed the
rest of the instructions
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually).

## A working Site?

With those instructions done, I visited [my site] (http://shortpgh.github.io/site).

Of course, I was still getting a 404 error that the page couldn't be found. The
instructions do say it can take some time, so I sat back and waited a bit. And
then it was there. My first github site is live.
